## Introduction

Rockspot Shawarma App is a cutting-edge PWA tailored for a seamless shawarma ordering experience. It aims to elevate customer satisfaction through an intuitive interface, fast order processing, and an enticing selection of shawarma offerings.

## Prerequisites

Before embarking on this exciting journey, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Setting Up the Vite React App

1. Open VS Code and create a new Vite React App:

   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest rockspot -- --template react
   cd rockspot
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to explore the app's initial setup.

## Designing the User Interface with Tailwind CSS

Craft an appealing UI using Tailwind CSS. Create reusable components, including visually striking cards to showcase the mouthwatering shawarma options.

## Adding PWA Functionality

Enhance the app with PWA features for offline access and a seamless mobile experience. Elevate customer engagement with push notifications and a standalone display.

## Temporary Backend Setup

For the initial development, employ a temporary JSON file as a backend. Create a `shawarmas.json` file in the `public` directory to simulate shawarma data.

```json
// public/shawarmas.json
{
  "shawarmas": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "Chicken Shawarma", "price": 1500 },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Beef Shawarma", "price": 1500 },
    { "id": 3, "name": "Combo Shawarma", "price": 2000 }
  ]
}
```

## Continue Building

Continue the development process by implementing features such as user authentication, ordering system, admin panel, payment process, and responsive design.
